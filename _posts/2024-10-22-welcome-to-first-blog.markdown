I've decided to start writing a blog about my own personal projects. Mostly to help me remember what I've done, have I actually learned something and lastly, to show off a bit. 

I admit that I have a bad habit of starting a new project while I have a bunch of old, old projects that are unfinished, but hopefully after writing down what I've done, catching up to speed should be a bit easier!

Recently I've started to work on my own game and started reading [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/), so most likely my next posts are going to be related to them. I do have some old projects that are really (IMO) interesting! I'll try to write a recap about those at some point.  


Let's see how long I'll manage to update this...
